#############################################

Arrays:

Creating Arrays:

Just like object, Arrays are declared within square braces as 

var a = [];
a[0]="Dhana";
a[1]="Mani";

Arrays can be multi-type.

Accessing Arrays:


var a = [];
a[0]="Dhana";
a[1]="Mani";

for(i=0; i<a.length; i++)
{
   alert(a[i]);
}

Concat and Slice:

Concat is used to concat elements in two arrays or string etc

Slice is used to split elements in arrays or string etc.


Push and Pop:

Push is used to add a new element to the end of array
Pop is used to remove last added element and return it.

Shift and Unshift:

Unshift is used to push new element to the start of array
Shift is used to remove first element from the array and return it.

Join and Split:

Join - Concatenate the array element as a string
str.split - Splits the string as array

Locating the element:

indexOf: search an element in the array and return its index, if element is not found -1 is returned
lastIndexOf - search an element in the array in reverse order and return its index
